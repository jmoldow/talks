I show, with a live demo/tutorial, that deploying and evaluating a Vitess ("A database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL" - https://vitess.io) sandbox cluster, into a public cloud environment, can be done super easily.

With the remaining demo time, I demonstrate other Vitess operations, Vitess fundamentals, and Kubernetes fundamentals.

Even with the best possible documentation (and the Vitess documentation is quite good!), getting a fully working cluster, experimenting with it, and getting everything configured the way you want can involve a bunch of trial and error. I hope that my demo can help you bypass some of the more boring trial-and-error, and get running more quickly with your Vitess evaluation.

For this demo, I use the excellent open-source Vitess-operator for Kubernetes, provided by PlanetScale. Even if you aren't considering deploying Vitess on Kubernetes in production, I still highly recommend it for sandbox use. Deploying an arbitrary number of components is super trivial with the operator, and everything auto-wires automatically. No need to delay your evaluation by needing to manually bootstrap a cluster one node at a time, or write your own deployment tools.
